    <h2>Tasty beans</h2>
    <p>Nigerian tasty beans, also known as stewed beans, is a dietary staple in many households in the country. It is called “ewa riro” in Yoruba or sometimes just referred to as “ewa”, which means beans. It is similar to the Ghanaian “red red” and is perfect for vegetarians.</p>

            <li>1 cup of Sliced onions</li>
            <li>4 ripe plantains</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by picking the beans. Pick to separate sand and impurities from the beans, remove every unwanted material from the beans. That is just the essence of picking the beans. Nigerian beans come mixed with some unwanted materials.</li>
            <li>Parboil the picked beans for three to five minutes before following with the rest of the procedures. Just add to boiling water, cook for three to five minutes then wash and set aside in a bowl.
            Grind the fresh red tomatoes/pepper and set aside, also slice onions, we need a cup of sliced onions.</li>
            <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, add about two to three cups of water, allow to boil before adding the parboiled beans. cook for 40-50 minutes with just onions. I learned that adding onions at the beginning speeds up the cooking process of beans.</li>
            <li>Cook the beans for thirty to fifty minutes until it is very soft for consumption. You can check this by pressing the beans against your cooking spoon using your thumb.</li>
            <li>Set another pot on heat, add the palm oil and allow to heat for about 4 minutes but don’t allow bleaching, add the ground tomatoes and allow it to fry, should take about 15-20 minutes.
            Once the beans are soft enough we proceed to step 3</li>
            <li>Add about a cup of water if the water is already dried, add the ground crayfish, stock cube, fried tomatoes/peppers. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for another ten minutes, and you are done with the making of my favorite bean’s recipe.</li>
        </ol>
